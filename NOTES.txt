Difference between Testing and Debugging:

Testing:
a) Testing is the process of running the software and determining that the 
results are what you expect them to be and, therefore, correct.

Debugging:
a)Process to i)locate the source of the bug
              ii) Determine how to fix the bug
              iii) Implement the solution.

--Testing and Debugging are the seperate tasks.

--the amount of bugs discovered is proportional to the amount of time
 spent debugging.

--All software has bugs in it.

--First bug was discovered by Grace Hopper, 70 years ago and was the developer
of COBOL Language.
