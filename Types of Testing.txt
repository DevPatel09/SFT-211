TYPES OF TESTING:

a) Unit Testing:
->basic type of testing.
->Breaks down the code into smaller parts usually functions and then test them
->Purpose: it is easier to find bugs in small piece of code rather than the whole
           big code.
->If each small parts are tested properly and are bug-free then integrate it.
->Unit tests normally test functions by passing them a known piece of data and 
  checking to see that the result is what is expected.
->Done by automated tools.

b) Black Box Testing:
->Black box testing is normally the first approach to designing unit tests.
->We dont know the code.
->Treats every functional unit as a black box.
->Black box testing relies entirely on knowing that a certain input should 
  produce a certain output.

c) White Box Testing:
->opposite of black box testing.
->we know the internal structure of the code.
->If we simply rely on black box testing there, is no guarantee that we would 
 have tested every single path through the code.
->Gives confidence about the testing of the code.

d) Integration Testing:
-> While unit testing tests the low level of the code, whereas this test makes sure
when combined should work properly.
->doesnot looks at the indivual parts but looks at the groups of functions to ensure
that it works properly.
->A unit testing framework can be used to carry out integration testing or it can
 be carried out in other ways.

e) End to End Testing​:
->Test from start to the end.
->This type of testing aims to identify and address issues that may arise when 
different components or modules of an application interact with each other, 
simulating how users would use the software in a production environment.
->replicate the user behavior and make sure all the user would perform work as expected.

f) Load Testing:
->Load testing is often combined with stress testing which tries to take it beyond
 the normal operating requirements to see when it will actually break.
->If stress testing reveals that your software will not break until well beyond 
your expected usage of it, then you are assured your software is in good shape.
->Checks whether the software functions correctly under high loads.

g) Security testing:
->Checks the software if it meets the security requiremets.
->might check that web page can only be reached after signing on to the website.
-> It might involve checking the level of user access to make sure that users 
can only access the information they are allowed to. 
->It could also involve attempts to break into the system and either steal or 
alter information stored within it.

h) Acceptance Testing​:
-> verifies that the application meets all the business requiements.
->After application is finished, it is checked using different examples of how user
  would acutally use the system.
->If all of the acceptance tests are met, then it indicates that the customer 
requirements have been met.

i) Regression Testing:
->Regression testing means we perform our existing tests after every change 
to the code. The goal of regression testing is to make sure that any changes 
we made to the code do not break the existing code.
->The goal of regression testing is to make sure that the code checked into 
the shared repository is free of bugs. This prevents other developers building 
upon code which has bugs in it.
