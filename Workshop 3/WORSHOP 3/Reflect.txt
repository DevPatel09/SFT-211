REFLECTION:

Ans) I have used Unit Testing to test the getCustomerInfo function which gives the detailed
information regarding the customers. This testing helps to find the bugs easily, because we 
testing only the small part of the whole code, which helps our mind to stress less to find
the bugs and solve them. For the functions that collect client information, I created unit 
tests. Several factors in that test case made blank lines impossible to enter. 
A notification stating "NOT A PROPER INPUT" is displayed whenever the user enters a 
blank line. For the numerous test cases and scenarios, manual testing was also 
done. Combining automated and human testing methods is essential to thoroughly 
test the application. Automated tests ensure that the functionality is maintained 
while the code changes, while human testing or unit testing can provide insights into the user experience 
and ensure that the software conforms to the necessary interactive behavior.
